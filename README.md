This repository is for documents related to the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The following code utilizes data (training and test) from Samsung's devices that is not initially tidy in order to make it a tidy dataset. The sets the working directory, uploads the requiered tables, assigns descriptive variable names, extracts columns reffering to the mean and standard deviation of each feature, merges the different tables into one unique table, aggregates this table by activity and subject, and finally saves the (second) tidy data set.

Note: the features did not suffer any transformations, so the codebook that was provided in the project continues to be valid.
